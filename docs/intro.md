# Tutorial Intro

Welcome to the ROS 2 Nervous System tutorial! This comprehensive guide will help you understand ROS 2 as the robotic nervous system for AI engineers and developers entering Physical AI and humanoid robotics.

## What You'll Learn

This tutorial is organized into three modules:

1. **Introduction to ROS 2** - Understand ROS 2 architecture and purpose, nodes, graphs, and DDS concepts
2. **ROS 2 Communication & Python AI** - Learn how to connect Python AI agents to ROS 2 systems
3. **Humanoid Structure with URDF** - Model humanoid robot structures using URDF for simulation and control

Each module builds upon the previous one, but can also be studied independently based on your needs.
