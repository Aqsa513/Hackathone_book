# Cognitive Planning with LLMs (NL → ROS 2 actions)

## Overview
This chapter covers the core cognitive planning capability that bridges natural language understanding with robot execution using Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert natural language commands into ROS 2 action sequences.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how LLMs process natural language commands
- Generate ROS 2 action sequences from natural language
- Implement cognitive planning for robot tasks
- Integrate LLMs with robotics execution systems

## Introduction
Large Language Models serve as the cognitive layer in VLA systems, converting high-level natural language instructions into executable action plans. This chapter explores how to use LLMs for cognitive planning in robotics applications.

## Key Concepts
- Natural language command interpretation
- Action plan generation from LLMs
- ROS 2 action sequence creation
- Task decomposition and planning
- Handling ambiguous commands

## Implementation Steps
1. Set up LLM integration for robotics applications
2. Process natural language commands through LLM
3. Generate ROS 2 action sequences from LLM output
4. Validate action plans before execution
5. Execute plans in simulation environment

## Best Practices
- Design clear prompt structures for consistent output
- Implement validation for generated action plans
- Handle ambiguous or unclear commands appropriately
- Include error recovery in action planning

## Summary
This chapter covered the cognitive planning layer using LLMs to convert natural language to ROS 2 actions. The next chapter will integrate these components into a complete autonomous humanoid system.
