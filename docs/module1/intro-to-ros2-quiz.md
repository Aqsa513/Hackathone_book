## True/False Questions

### 6. ROS 2 addresses limitations of ROS 1 by providing real-time support.
A) True
B) False

**Answer: A) True**

### 7. Nodes in ROS 2 communicate directly with each other without any middleware.
A) True
B) False

**Answer: B) False**

### 8. The computation graph represents how data flows through the ROS 2 system.
A) True
B) False

**Answer: A) True**

## Short Answer Questions

### 9. Explain how ROS 2 functions as the robotic nervous system.

**Answer: ROS 2 functions as the nervous system of a robot by: 1) Sensing - collecting data from various sensors, 2) Processing - analyzing sensor data and making decisions, 3) Acting - sending commands to actuators and motors, and 4) Communicating - coordinating between different components.**

### 10. What are the key benefits of using DDS as the middleware in ROS 2?

**Answer: DDS provides: 1) Automatic discovery - nodes find each other automatically, 2) Reliable transport - guaranteed message delivery, 3) Quality of Service - configurable reliability and performance settings, and 4) Data-centricity - communication based on data rather than connections.**

## Summary

This quiz covers the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 architecture, including nodes, the computation graph, DDS, and the role of ROS 2 as a robotic nervous system. Understanding these concepts is essential for working with ROS 2 systems.
