# Digital Twin Module Planning

## User Prompt

```
1. Add Module 2 (Digital Twin: Gazebo & Unity) to the Docusaurus docs structure; all content will be written in `.md` files.
2. Create three chapter Markdown files covering Gazebo physics, Unity environments, and simulated sensors, and register them in the sidebar.
```

## Response Summary

Completed planning for Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) documentation. The module was already properly structured with:
- Three main chapter files: gazebo-physics-simulation.md, unity-high-fidelity-rendering.md, and simulated-sensors.md
- Associated exercise and quiz files for each chapter
- Proper registration in the Docusaurus sidebar configuration (sidebars.js)
- Research, data model, and quickstart documents created as part of planning process

The documentation structure follows Docusaurus best practices with a clear learning path covering physics simulation, high-fidelity rendering, and sensor simulation. All content is organized under the module2 directory and properly categorized in the navigation sidebar.
