# Implement Modules 1 and 2

## User Input

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response Summary

Successfully implemented both Module 1 (ROS 2 Nervous System) and Module 2 (Digital Twin: Gazebo & Unity) as specified in the feature requirements. The implementation includes:

1. **Module 1: ROS 2 Nervous System** - Complete documentation covering:
   - Introduction to ROS 2
   - ROS 2 Communication & Python AI Integration
   - Humanoid Structure with URDF

2. **Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Complete documentation covering:
   - Physics Simulation with Gazebo
   - High-Fidelity Environments with Unity
   - Simulated Sensors (LiDAR, Depth, IMU)

Each module includes:
- Main content chapters
- Hands-on exercises
- Quizzes for testing understanding

The site is configured with proper navigation, sidebar organization, and styling. The sidebar properly separates Module 1 and Module 2 with clear hierarchy: Modules → Chapters → Exercises/Quizzes.

All tasks from both modules' tasks.md files have been completed and marked as done.

## Outcome

Both Module 1 (ROS 2 Nervous System) and Module 2 (Digital Twin) documentation modules have been successfully implemented and are ready for use. The site is accessible and includes all required content with proper organization and navigation as specified in the requirements.
