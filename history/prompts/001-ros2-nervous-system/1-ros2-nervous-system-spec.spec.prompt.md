## Prompt

```
Module 1: ROS 2 Nervous System with 3 chapters using Docusaurus; output as Markdown (.md)
```

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification for the ROS 2 Nervous System module. The specification includes three prioritized user stories covering: 1) Introduction to ROS 2 (P1), 2) ROS 2 Communication & Python AI Integration (P2), and 3) Humanoid Structure Modeling with URDF (P3). The specification defines 12 functional requirements, 5 key entities, and 6 measurable success criteria. Edge cases and quality validation checklist are also included.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete specification for ROS 2 module
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required for specification creation
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md and requirements checklist
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for planning and implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification covers all required aspects with measurable outcomes

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A for specification document
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation planning for ROS 2 module
